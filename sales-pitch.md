1.) Supported by Microsoft, used at Yahoo, eHarmony, MasterCard, Amazon, and a few other companies.

2.) One of the top platforms used for winning Kaggle competitions (more popular than Spark)

3.) Many more algorithm choices and tuning parameters than Spark

4.) Higher typical model accuracy than Spark

5.) Much faster than Spark 1.6 in most scenarios

6.) Much less RAM and disk intensive than Spark 1.6

7.) Models can be saved and updated on the fly, which would allow truly streaming recs

8.) Can autogenerate a lot of features (e.g., automatic tokenization) so we'd need less dev time to make new algorithms

9.) Less dependencies (only C and Python needed)

10.) Significantly faster to run test suite on laptop
